        <p class=" paragraph mb-lg">
          As part of a close-knit team, boys take on big responsibilities, such as cooking for a group of 10 people and maintaining
          and repairing equipment. Each boy is trained and supported by experienced leaders, held accountable for their actions,
          and given progressively greater levels of responsibility.
          Boys who return for multiple expeditions have the opportunity to become leaders of the expedition.
